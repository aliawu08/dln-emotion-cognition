# Manuscript

This folder contains submission-ready manuscript files for the DLN Emotion–Cognition study.

## Files
- `Paper2_Emotion_Cognition_SubmissionReady.docx` (submission-ready)
- `Paper2_Emotion_Cognition_SubmissionReady.pdf` (submission-ready export)
- `paper2.tex` (LaTeX version, styled to match the DLN-series LaTeX formatting)

## Compile (optional)
If you prefer the LaTeX workflow:

```bash
cd manuscript
pdflatex paper2.tex
pdflatex paper2.tex
```

Canonical workflow:
- For **arXiv**, use `paper2.tex` (builds to `paper2.pdf`).
- For **Word/APA submissions**, use the DOCX (and its PDF export).

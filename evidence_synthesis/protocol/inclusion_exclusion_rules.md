# Inclusion / Exclusion Rules (Operational)

## Minimal inclusion checklist
A record is included if all are true:
- It is a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis or systematic review with quantitative pooling).
- It reports standardized effect sizes OR provides sufficient information to derive effect sizes.
- The methods/tasks can be described sufficiently to code DLN stage.

## Exclusion triggers
Exclude if any are true:
- No quantitative pooling or effect sizes.
- Irretrievable effect-size information after reasonable attempts.
- Task description too vague to assign architecture without speculation.

## Ambiguous cases
If coding is possible but uncertain:
- include as `mixed_unclear`
- record rationale and what additional information would resolve ambiguity

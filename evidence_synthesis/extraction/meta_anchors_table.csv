Domain / construct,Meta-analytic source,"k (studies / comparisons), N",Summary result,Heterogeneity signal,DLN-stage interpretation (sketch)
Emotion regulation strategy effectiveness,"Webb, Miles, & Sheeran (2012)",306 experimental comparisons,Cognitive change d+≈0.36; response modulation d+≈0.16; attentional deployment d+≈0.00,Effects vary sharply by strategy family; some suppression forms near-zero or negative,Linear suppression can reduce expression yet carry cognitive costs; network reappraisal integrates affect and supports flexibility
Implicit cognition and behavior,"Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, & Banaji (2009)","122 reports, 184 samples; N≈14,900","IAT predictive validity r≈0.274 (explicit measures r≈0.361, but more variable)",Predictive validity is real but modest; substantial variation by criterion and context,Linear-stage compartmentalization yields larger implicit-explicit gaps; network stage predicts tighter alignment
Interoception and alexithymia,"Trevisan, Altschuler, Bagdasarov, & McPartland (2019)","66 independent samples; N≈7,146","Overall r≈−0.162 (alexithymia vs interoceptive awareness), with component-specific differences",Association depends on measurement component and sample characteristics,Dot/linear stages predict decoupling between bodily signals and emotion concepts; network stage predicts stronger coupling
Heartbeat counting task validity,Desmedt et al. (2022),"133 studies; N≈11,524","HCT performance shows near-zero links with trait anxiety (r≈0.03), depression (r≈−0.04), and alexithymia (r≈−0.01)",Null/weak associations suggest measurement noise and construct-mismatch; encourages moderator-focused synthesis,Stage effects may emerge more clearly in tasks that index integration (network) rather than raw detection under dot/linear separation
Alexithymia vs emotional awareness measures,"Maroti, Lilliengren, & Bileviciute-Ljungar (2018)","21 studies, 28 samples; N≈2,857",TAS-20 vs LEAS aggregated r≈−0.122,Moderate heterogeneity; weak overlap implies measures capture distinct components,DLN predicts non-linear mapping: self-report beliefs vs performance-based integration diverge under linear compartmentalization
Affective decision making task performance,"Zanini, Picano, & Spitoni (2025)",110 studies (IGT),"Sex difference in classic 100-trial IGT UMD≈3.381 (males higher), with significant heterogeneity",Large between-study variability not resolved by standard moderators,DLN suggests IGT outcomes depend on whether affective value signals are integrated (network) or treated as noise (linear)
Emotional approach coping and health,Hoyt et al. (2024),86 studies,"Overall health association r≈0.05 (95% CI ≈[0.003, 0.10]); domain-specific sign changes",Marked heterogeneity across outcomes and measures; effects can flip by health domain,"Network integration can make emotional processing adaptive in some domains, yet linear rumination can worsen distress"
